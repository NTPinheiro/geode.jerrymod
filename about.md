# Say hi to my raspberry pi 5, now in Geometry Dash!
## His name is Jerry short for Jerinald

This mod adds a button to the homescreen of Geometry Dash. Clicking it opens a popup that allows you to press a button to say hi to Jerry, as well as a picture. The number in the popup is the total amount of people that have said hi to Jerry.

Jerry hosts [ntpinheiro.com](https://ntpinheiro.com) if you want to check it out. You can also say hi to him there!

Thank you Firee for pretty much making half of this mod and for setting up the api.
